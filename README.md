StripePy is a CLI application written in Python that recognizes architectural stripes found in the interaction matrix files
generated by Chromosome Conformation Capture experiments, such as Hi-C and Micro-C.

StripePy is developed on Linux and macOS and is also tested on Windows. Installing StripePy is quick and easy using pip:

```bash
pip install 'stripepy-hic[all]'
```

For other installation options (conda, source, and Docker or Singularity/Apptainer), and details on ensuring StripePy is in your `PATH`, please refer to the official documentation.

## Why Choose StripePy?

StripePy stands out with several key features that make it a fast and robust stripe caller:

- **Broad Format Support**: Compatible with major formats: `.hic`, `.cool` and `.mcool`; outputs to `.hdf5` and `BEDPE`.
- **User-Friendly**: Designed with an intuitive command-line interface, making stripe analysis accessible even to less experienced users.
- **Stripe descriptors**: Computes stripe width, height, and generates various statistics for post-processing, e.g., ranking and filtering.
- **Optimized performance**: Outperforms other tools over diverse datasets and a simulated benchmark, StripeBench.
- **Exceptional speed & Low Memory**: Significantly faster than existing tools (2x Chromosight, 66x Stripenn), with much lower memory usage.

## Key Features

StripePy is organized into a few subcommands:

- `stripepy download`: download a minified sample dataset suitable to quickly test StripePy.
- `stripepy call`: run the stripe detection algorithm and store the identified stripes in a `.hdf5` file.
- `stripepy view`: take the `result.hdf5` file generated by `stripepy call` and extract stripes in BEDPE format.
- `stripepy plot`: generate various kinds of plots to inspect the stripes identified by `stripepy call`.

For more information on the subcommands, please run `stripepy --help` and refer to the documentation and the paper.
